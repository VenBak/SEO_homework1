# SEO_homework1

## Description

This repository's purpose was to improve a website's search engine optimization. My motivation was for the website to have a better chance of appearing as one of the first search results when looking for the particular name of the website called Horiseon and go through the learning experience. This was done through changing particular div elements into semantic ones, learning about web crawlers and what particular things they look at such as meta elements and the title. The problem which was solved was to change div elements into semantic ones on an html file whilst silmuntaniously not disrupting the css file for the appearance to remain unchanged.
